Notes

- Analysis of this data is similar to the analysis of the lactamase data.

- The individual decision tree model suffered from instability. Hence, its ensemble method Random Forest was used.

- mtry was tuned in a different R script, with the optimal value found to be the default value. No other parameters significantly affect the accuracy of the model.
