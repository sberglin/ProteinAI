# Notes
- GR's paper explores **rich** (non-separable covariance) covariance structures with **exact** inference on **large** datasets with **multiple outputs**
- Can we integrate kernel information into the updates nicely?
- Take out gpytorch.mlls.ExactMarginalLogLikelihood from Simulation notebook since it "cannot be used in conjunction with stochastic optimization" according to the [GPyTorch docs](https://gpytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/marginal_log_likelihoods.html#gpytorch.mlls.ExactMarginalLogLikelihood).
