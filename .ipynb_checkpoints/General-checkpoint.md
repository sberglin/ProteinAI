# To-Do

- Why is loss increasing? Why does noise keep marching up?
- Apply Adam to Simulation 3 to see if it helps
- Add a higher dimensional example and try to get it working. If expensive, use GPyTorch parallelization?
- I have worked 2 hours extra (for Sunday). Log it for 11/10 (Sunday) on 11/11 (Monday).

Minor

- Can we integrate kernel information into the updates nicely? Try to formalize this
