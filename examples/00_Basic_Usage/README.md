# Basic Usage

This folder contains notebooks for basic usage of the package, e.g. things like dealing with hyperparameters,
parameter constraints and priors, and saving and loading models. Before checking these out, you may want to see our
simple GP regression notebooks that detail the anatomy of a GPyTorch model [here](../01_Simple_GP_Regression).

- Check out our [Tutorial on Hyperparameters](./Hyperparameters.ipynb) for information on things like raw versus actual
  parameters, constraints, priors and more.
- The [Saving and loading models](./Saving_and_Loading_Models.ipynb) notebook details how to save and load GPyTorch models
  on disk.
